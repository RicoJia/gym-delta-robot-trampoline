Description: # Gym Delta Robot Trampoline
        
        Authors: Rico Ruotong Jia(ruotongjia2020@u.northwestern.edu), Yipeng Pan 
        
        The trampoline bounces a ball using a delta arm trained by DDPG! We also have included a PyBullet + OpenAI Gym environment of a Delta_Arm.

        ### Minimum System Requirement
        - Python 3.6
        
        ### Links 
         - Github [https://github.com/RicoJia/gym-delta-robot-trampoline](https://github.com/RicoJia/gym-delta-robot-trampoline)
         - Pypi [https://pypi.org/project/gym-delta-robot-trampoline/](https://pypi.org/project/gym-delta-robot-trampoline/)
        
        ### Install
        Install with `pip`:
        
            pip3 install gym_delta_robot_trampoline
            
        Or, install from source:
        
            git clone https://github.com/RicoJia/gym-delta-robot-trampoline
            cd gym-delta-robot-trampoline
            pip install .
        
        ### Usage
        
        To see the environment, in the root of the package on Github [https://github.com/RicoJia/gym-delta-robot-trampoline](https://github.com/RicoJia/gym-delta-robot-trampoline)
        Download ```main.py```
        
             python3 main.py
        You can interact with the environment by clicking and dragging, but note that our simulation is running much 
        faster than real time, so you might not see the ball falling to the ground before the episode ends, or 
        you might see a higher reward than expected due to small vibrations in our mouse dragging motion.
